Istio has many more features whose scope is beyond the workshop. We encourage you to dig deeper into the [Istio docs](https://istio.io/latest/docs/){target=_blank} yourself.

You might also be interested in the free courses offered at the [Tetrate Academy](https://academy.tetrate.io/){target=\_blank}, including _Istio Fundamentals_, and _Envoy Fundamentals_.
